# Liu-Cheng Xu's Blog
⭐️ My Personal Blog

## About my blog
The current theme is a variation of [yinwang](http://www.yinwang.org/), which I have made many modifications for a better reading experience.
To keep it simpler, I use native CSS and JS directly to beautify the blog and try to keep only some indispensable parts of a jekyll blog.

## Like it ?
If you want to build a jekyll blog like mine, it is unnecessary to start from scratch.
You can continue to revise it based on the current edition with only a little knowledge about HTML and CSS. It is painless to design your own blog.

## 简介
博客主题源自 [yinwang](http://www.yinwang.org/)，在此基础上依个人喜好做了诸多修缮。如果您也喜欢这个风格，希望再进一步修改与适配，只需懂一点点的 HTML 与 CSS 相关知识即可。为了保持博客结构精简，容易上手，我仅保留了 jekyll blog 的一些必需元素，欢迎试用。
