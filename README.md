# Liu-Cheng Xu's Blog

## About my blog
The current theme is a variation of [yinwang](http://www.yinwang.org/), which I have made many modifications for a better reading experience.
To keep it simpler, I use native CSS and JS directly to beautify the blog and try to keep only some indispensable parts of a jekyll blog.

## Like it ?
If you want to build a jekyll blog like mine, it is unnecessary to start from scratch.
You can continue to revise it based on the current edition with only a little knowledge about HTML and CSS. It is painless to design your own blog.
